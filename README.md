Problem - We don't have any platforms that has all kind of local shops at one place, where people can view and filter the shops based on the distance from their home. Also, people don't have any option to compare the same products from different shops in the present platforms. 

Solution - We have thought to develop a responsive website, which will have all kind of local shops (grocery, medical, bakery, etc.), where customers can filters and see, compare and buy the products with ease. We will use HTML, CSS, JS, APIs, framework and libraries.

Benefits - Customer can get the best deal at same price from our platforms and can also see the availability of the products in the shop, which will save their money and time.
